# Learning Machine Learning

I use `venv` here. Run these before running codes.

```shell
python -m venv ml-venv 
ml-venv\Scripts\Activate
```

Once the venv is active run the following command only once.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Because we are in a venv, first go in the folder location and then run the .py files as follows.

```shell
cd .\data_preprocessing\
python .\data_preprocessing_tools.py
```
